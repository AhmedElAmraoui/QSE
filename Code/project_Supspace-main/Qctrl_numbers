This is from a post of Q-CTRL, which we may use to estimate QPU time for IBM:
The smallest problems we solved (28–32 nodes MaxCut) implemented 12 optimization steps, which totals to 72 circuits, each executed with 6,000 shots to a total of 432,000 shots throughout the full optimization process. IBM’s reported repetition time is ∼ 4, 000 shots per second, resulting in an ideal QPU time of 108 seconds. In practice, the measured QPU time of these jobs is about 150 seconds."
Thus the calculation divides 150s/6000 when it should be 150s/432,000.  The correct value of t_sample is not 25ms, but rather ~0.25-0.3ms.
